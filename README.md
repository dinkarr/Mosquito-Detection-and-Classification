# Mosquito-Detection-and-Classification
A deep learning-based project aimed at detecting and classifying mosquitoes in images using fine-tuned YOLOv8. The model is trained to identify mosquito species and evaluate the detection performance using Mean Average Precision (mAP). This project leverages the \textbf{Ultralytics YOLOv8} library for efficient object detection and classification.
